# Church Encodings

Code demonstrating a reactive stream implementation with and without Church encoded representation.

Code:
 - `baseline`: the baseline non-Church encoded implementation that contains a flaw
 - `termination`: the baseline implementation with the flaw fixed
 - `partial`: partially Church encoded and partially transformed to continuation passing style (CPS)
 - `church`: fully Church encoded and CPSed
